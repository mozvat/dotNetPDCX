{"name":"Dotnetpdcx","tagline":"A C# example of integrating to the dsiPDCX","body":"### Welcome to the C# dsiPDCX sdk.\r\nThis is a basic integration demonstrating how to initialize and perform a basic credit sale utilizing the out-of-scope solution dsiPDCX from DataCap. [http://www.datacapsystems.com/](http://www.datacapsystems.com/)  I integrated using a MagTek IPad.\r\n\r\n### Basic overview\r\nThe DataCap dsiPDCX can be downloaded at: [http://www.datacapepay.com/dsipdcx.htm](http://www.datacapepay.com/dsipdcx.htm)\r\n\r\nBelow is the basic dataflow. Notice the communication of sensitive card data is contained within the dsiPDCX and the peripheral device. The dsiPDCX communicates with an in-store light-weight 'In Store NetEpay' server. This server communicates with Mercury Payment Systems, (Or other payment processors).  The POS software interacts only with the dsiPDCX to get the results from the credit card processor. \r\n\r\n![DataFlow](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-z9V7Y9VPEGY1laTm9MRWM3Smc/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### Supported Devices\r\nThe dsiPDCX communicates with a fairly large number of devices. Request from DataCap an integration guide to get the latest supported devices. Below shows this list of devices.\r\n\r\n![List 1](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-z9V7Y9VPEGb3UtbmxxX2ZhZnc/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n![List 2](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-z9V7Y9VPEGeU9VT2JLY2czLUE/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### Basic Integration:\r\nFirst, you have to reference the dsiPDCX.ocx within your project. Then perform a couple of initialization steps.\r\n\r\nNotice you set the IPs, this includes a back-up IP. TakeNote: dsiPDCX can be configured to communicate with the 'In-Store NetEPay' or directly to Mercury's NetEPay server.\r\n\r\n1) Set the IPs\r\n2) Set the timeouts.\r\n3) Pass in the device initialize XML to the ProcessTransation() method.\r\n![Initialize!](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-z9V7Y9VPEGeTVWUW5OMTVEMlU/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nHere is the Device Initialization XML\r\n![Initialize Devie XML](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-z9V7Y9VPEGblktSkg4Z3JOanc/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nThe examples are referencing my app-config file.\r\n![AppConfig](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-z9V7Y9VPEGMVZQc3RkeGE2dkU/edit?usp=sharing) \r\n\r\nAfter this setup. Make your basic credit call.\r\n\r\nstring response2 = DSIPDCXWrapper.Instance.Class.ProcessTransaction(Credit.SwipedSaleXML(txtAmount.Text, \"1235\", \"5555\").ToString(), (short)ProcessControl.NoDialogBoxes, string.Empty, string.Empty);\r\n\r\n### Manual entry of credit card data\r\nIf the magstripe is damaged and unable to be read by a swipe. You can send a command to the IPAD to request manual entry of Credit Card information.\r\n\r\n![Manual entry](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-z9V7Y9VPEGT1p4TzQ2N1ZsZlU/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n(**Disclaimer** The credit card number on a screen is a test number)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
